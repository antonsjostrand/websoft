                        My name is Anton Sjöstrand, I'm 27 years old and I live in central Kristianstad. As of right now I'm studying computer science at Högskolan Kristianstad, graduating this summer. The time between that I graduated highschool and I started my studies at 2017 I have worked at 3 different jobs. I've worked as a store employee at both Harald Nyborg and Media Markt. At 2014 I move on to work at Zafe Care Systems AB as a support technician. This is where I found and developed my interest for programming, leading to the fact that I quit my job and started studying 2017.
                    
                        Since then programming has been one of my main interests. Other interests I have include hanging out with my friends and family, playing all different types of sports and working out.
                    
                        Looking forward to participate in this course.
