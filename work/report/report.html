<section>
<h2>S01</h2>
<p class="report-question">Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages? </p>
    <p class="report-answer">I did know about the techniques Git and GitHub. These are tools that we have used throughout the program
    and I've utilized them when working as well. I didn't know about Markdown or GitHub Pages, however they seem 
    to be really convenient and I look forward to utilize them more.</p>
    
    <p class="report-question">Have you ever created websites before?</p>
    <p class="report-answer">I haven't created a complete website before that I've published for others to see. I have however tried both HTML and CSS, both privately and at work.
    At work I've done some minor changes to web applications which involved altering some HTML and CSS code.</p>
    
    <p class="report-question">Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
    <p class="report-answer" >I haven't gotten that much experience or knowledge in the field of web application development at this very moment. 
    The only experience I have at this very moment comes from working a bit at Axis in Lund where I coded a 
    bit in PHP in their CRM-system and as previously mentioned some HTML and CSS. Unfortunately I had other tasks as well which mean I didn't get to do it all that much.
    My knowledge basically consists of the very basic stuff, such as what the different parts are invovled (front-end/back-end) and how web applications can 
    communicate with each other. But now I've just started working at "Studentlitteratur" where I will be working in the back-end of one of their web applications.
    So hopefully within a couple of weeks my knowledge and experience will be way greater than it is right now.</p>
    
    <p class="report-question">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p class="report-answer">My TIL for this section I would say is mostly git related topics. I had never forked a repository before and found that interesting.
    I've also learned how to utilize GitHub Pages, which was extremely convenient and fun to use. I've learned some new git commands, such as tag.
    I also increased my understanding of how repositories work and what is meant by upstream and downstream.

<h2>S02</h2>
<p class="report-question">Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
<p class="report-answer">I haven't gotten that much experience of either of this techniques.
     As I mentioned in the previous report I've done some HTML and CSS privately and some at work but nothing major.
    Perhaps only changed a few lines of code, easy work such as changing color or sizes mostly. 
    I haven't really worked with JavaScript at all at. I've seen it, but haven't worked with it.
</p>
<p class="report-question">Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
<p class="report-answer">
    HTML is used by web-developers to structure the content of a website. Basically one can say that HTML provides a skeleton that could be further built upon using other languages.
    CSS is the code with which web-developers can style their websites. That is you style the skeleton created by HTML, both by altering the looks of the elements but also by changing the position of said elements.
    And finally JavaScript. JavaScript is used to make a website interactive, without it a website would be very stale. With JavaScript web-developers can add such things as animations to their website.
    To conclude you can shortly say that: HTML is the skeleton of the web, CSS is what adds the flesh and muscle and JavaScript brings the page to life.
</p>
<p class="report-question">Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>
<p class="report-answer">
    So basically what happens is that a user enters the URL to a page that they want to visit. To know where this page can be found the browser first needs to consult a DNS-server.
    When the browser knows the address of the page it sends a get request, that is it utilizes the HTTP protocol, to the web-server asking for a copy of the requested website. 
    The web-server accepts the request and responds with a response code to indicate that it is okey for the browser to access the page. This code is "200 OK".
    The web-server then transmits the data to the browser making it possible for the user of the browser to view the page he/she requested.
</p>
<p class="report-question">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
<p class="report-answer">
    Due to the fact that I've encountered HTML and CSS at work and done some stuff privately I can't say that I've learned that much about those aspects of this section.
    However, I feel that I've gotten a better understanding of JavaScript and I'm looking forward to write some JavaScript-code.
