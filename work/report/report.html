<h2>S01</h2>
<p class="report-question">Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages? </p>
    <p class="report-answer">I did know about the techniques Git and GitHub. These are tools that we have used throughout the program
    and I've utilized them when working as well. I didn't know about Markdown or GitHub Pages, however they seem 
    to be really convenient and I look forward to utilize them more.</p>
    
    <p class="report-question">Have you ever created websites before?</p>
    <p class="report-answer">I haven't created a complete website before that I've published for others to see. I have however tried both HTML and CSS, both privately and at work.
    At work I've done some minor changes to web applications which involved altering some HTML and CSS code.</p>
    
    <p class="report-question">Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
    <p class="report-answer" >I haven't gotten that much experience or knowledge in the field of web application development at this very moment. 
    The only experience I have at this very moment comes from working a bit at Axis in Lund where I coded a 
    bit in PHP in their CRM-system and as previously mentioned some HTML and CSS. Unfortunately I had other tasks as well which mean I didn't get to do it all that much.
    My knowledge basically consists of the very basic stuff, such as what the different parts are invovled (front-end/back-end) and how web applications can 
    communicate with each other. But now I've just started working at "Studentlitteratur" where I will be working in the back-end of one of their web applications.
    So hopefully within a couple of weeks my knowledge and experience will be way greater than it is right now.</p>
    
    <p class="report-question">What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    <p class="report-answer">My TIL for this section I would say is mostly git related topics. I had never forked a repository before and found that interesting.
    I've also learned how to utilize GitHub Pages, which was extremely convenient and fun to use. I've learned some new git commands, such as tag.
    I also increased my understanding of how repositories work and what is meant by upstream and downstream.

<h2>S02</h2>
<p class="report-question">Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>
<p class="report-answer">I haven't gotten that much experience of either of this techniques. As I mentioned in the previous report I've done some HTML and CSS privately and some at work but nothing major. Perhaps only changed a few lines of code, easy work such as changing color or sizes mostly. I haven't really worked with JavaScript at all at. I've seen it, but haven't worked with it.</p>
<p class="report-question">Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>
<p class="report-answer"></p>
<p class="report-question">Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>
<p class="report-answer"></p>
