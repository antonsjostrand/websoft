Report.txt contains the answers to the questions in assignment 1.

I did know about the techniques Git and GitHub and have used them a lot.
However I didn't know about Markdown or GitHub Pages, which both seem really nice.
I haven't created a website before, I have tried some html/css but never finished an entire website.
I haven't gotten that much experience or knowledge in the field of web application development at this very moment. 
The only experience and knowledge I have at this very moment comes from working a bit at Axis in Lund where I coded a 
bit in PHP in their CRM-system, unfortunately I had other tasks as well which mean I didn't get to do it all that much.
But now I've just started working at "Studentlitteratur" where I will be working in the back-end of one of their web applications.
So hopefully within a couple of weeks my knowledge and experience will be way greater than it is right now.
My TIL for this section is mostly what is included in the area of web application development and what techniques are used,
but also I've learned valuable things about git, especially the forking-part and how to use GitHub Pages.
